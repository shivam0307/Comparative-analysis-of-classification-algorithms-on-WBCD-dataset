# Comparative-analysis-of-classification-algorithms-on-WBCD-dataset

Breast cancer is a major public health concern worldwide, and early detection is critical for
successful treatment and management. In recent years, machine learning algorithms have been
increasingly used for breast cancer diagnosis and prognosis prediction. In this study, the complete
analysis comprises two parts. First, we perform the data analysis to understand the distribution,
visualization, important features, and characteristics of the widely used Wisconsin Breast Cancer
Diagnostic (WBCD) dataset. Then we perform a comparative analysis of three classification algorithms: Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Artificial Neural Network dataset. We
evaluate the performance of these algorithms based on various metrics which are recall, precision,
accuracy, and f-score.

This study contributes to the growing body of research on the application of machine learning
algorithms in the field of breast cancer diagnosis and prognosis prediction and can help clinicians
and researchers make informed decisions when choosing a classification algorithm for their specific application.
